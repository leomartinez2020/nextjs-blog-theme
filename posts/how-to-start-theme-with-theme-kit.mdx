In order to start a them from scratch using theme kit we have to download theme kit. On linux
it can be done with the next command:
```
curl -s https://shopify.dev/themekit.py | sudo python3
```
On MacOS we can use Homebrew:
```
brew tap shopify/shopify
brew install themekit
```

And on Windows we can use Chocolatey:
```
choco install themekit
```

After that the administrator has open the Theme Access App as shown in the image:
![theme access app](/theme-access-app.png)

Then the administartor creates the password and sends it to the developer's email.
![theme password](/theme-access-pwd.png)

The developer retrieves the password from the email and then a new theme can be created
using this command:
```
theme new --password=shptka_700d05w88dc81tyc8162022da283ge88 --store="mystore.myshopify.com" --name=mytheme
```

The following files and directories are created:
```
assets  config  config.yml  layout  locales  templates
```

With the next command we can see what themes have been created:
```
theme get --list --password=shptka_700d05w88dc81tyc8162022da283ge88 --store="mystore.myshopify.com"
```

In order to keep track of the changes in the local file system and push the changes to the Shopify
store we could use this command:
```
theme watch
```

If we want to avoid pushing changes every time we save a file we could use 
 `theme deploy`. `theme deploy` will replace all files in the store. A better option
 could be to push chages of a single file like in the next command:
```
 theme deploy templates/404.liquid
```
